## Backend Implementation

### Architecture

We'll use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for the backend architecture in C#. Here's a proposed project and folder structure:

```
smart-expense-control/
├── src/
│ ├── SmartExpenseControl.Api/
│ ├── SmartExpenseControl.Application/
│ ├── SmartExpenseControl.Domain/
│ ├── SmartExpenseControl.Infrastructure/
│ └── SmartExpenseControl.Infrastructure.CrossCutting/
├── tests/
│ ├── SmartExpenseControl.Api.Tests/
│ ├── SmartExpenseControl.Application.Tests/
│ ├── SmartExpenseControl.Domain.Tests/
│ └── SmartExpenseControl.Infrastructure.Tests/
└── database/
    └── scripts/
        ├── 001_create_tables.sql
        └── 010_insert_user_roles.sql
    └── docker-compose.yml
```

### Database

We'll use MySQL for the database. The database scripts are located in the `database/scripts/` folder.

### Docker Compose

We'll use Docker Compose to set up the MySQL database. The Docker Compose file is located at the root of the project.

### Steps to Run the Backend

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start the MySQL database.
4. Implement the backend services in C# using the proposed project structure.
5. Run the backend services.
